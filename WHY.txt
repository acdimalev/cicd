what am I avoiding?

- automation outside of repositories / otherwise undocumented
- no reasonable manual way to perform automation
- excessively inefficient software (well outside my financial budget)
- mountains of dependencies to investigate and troubleshoot (well outside my time budget)
- inconsistent mechanisms for automatically and manually scheduling work
